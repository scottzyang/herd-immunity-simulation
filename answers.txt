What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
  - Population size: 1000
  - Vaccinated Percentage: 0.4
  - Virus Name: Sniffles
  - Mortality Rate: 0.4
  - Reproduction Rate: 1000

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
  - Final Population Infected: 357

What percentage of the population died from the virus?
  - Final Fatalities: 243

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
- Vax_saves: 57794
